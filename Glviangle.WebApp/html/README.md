- The tags img, p, a, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 each must be wrapped by 1 div.
- The text tags only style the font attributes ...
- The img tag should use width: 100% instead of max-width: 100%; (If you want to fix IE bug, just let it be fun ....)
- If you want to style the img tag, the set at the wrap div should not be set directly to the img tag.
- For pages with FormCode Edit form submit in folder ENV
- Rule class component method has \_ in startKey it's private method

## use lazy to load image

- add attr: data-is-firstload="true" => Load this image first
- add attr: data-src="{url}",lazy load image after DOM loaded, Ex: "img(data-src="link h√¨nh", lazy, src="/loading.gif")"
